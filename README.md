# LLM Text Detection

This project involved developing models to distinguish between text written by humans and by LLMs, and to compare various approaches to find one that could make significant improvements to what already existed. We used SVMs, RoBERTa, and LoRa, and ultimately ended up achieving over 90% accuracy on the HC3 dataset.

This project was done for COM SCI 162 at UCLA.
